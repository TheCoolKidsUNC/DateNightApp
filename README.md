# Dates R Us
Team Project

An app for couples who need a date night but are too indifferent to make a choice. 

Users can input zip code, select one genre (or add own genre), and one type of food (or add type of food), and the app will display 3 movie options and 3 restaurant options. The user can choose one from each list, and we will display additional details about the date (times, location, links to restaurant and ticket buying, reviews).
